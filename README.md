# ARVC_ML
Overview
This repository contains machine learning algorithms developed to improve the early diagnosis of Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy (ARVC), a hereditary structural heart disease characterized by fibro-fatty myocardial replacement, arrhythmias, and risk of sudden cardiac death. Leveraging a matrix of clinical, imaging, ECG, and genetic features, this project evaluates multiple classification algorithms to differentiate ARVC patients from controls with high predictive performance.
Our models demonstrate that ML approaches can capture complex nonlinear relationships among diagnostic features and may serve as complementary tools alongside existing Task Force Criteria (TFC).
